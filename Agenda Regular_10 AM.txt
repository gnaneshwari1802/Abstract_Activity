data science ==> data + science 
data -->
how the data borns -:
1- customer 
2- internet -- 
column name == attribute == features == variable 
strucuted data = supervised learning = labeled data  
ipl match 
you see the visualization -- ipl data visualization -- data analyst 
database -- historical data 
python code -- visualize -- data visualization

data visualization tools in python proagram -- numpy, matplotlibe, seaborn 
structure data c
-- If you not understan few of this thing no need to worry 

customer data -- data which we extracted from the database -- structured | supervised | labled data
internet -- netfl  

When you deals with unstructed data -- image, video, audio, speech, text,voice, -- AI

EDA (Explaratory Data Analysis) 
------------
If your not understand then you never ever understanding datascience

datascice -- data -- supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning

supervised learning --> regression, classfication 
unsupervised learning - clustering 

RAW DATA  -- the data which contain missing value 
CLEAN DATA -- the data which no missing value 

architecture to process the data before we build predictive model 

data analyst - always worked on historical data 
data enginer - if the data is too big then always worked on big data tools

every thing you can work on panda 

if the dataset is not cleaned you never predict the future and you never build any ml models 

clean the data from raw data - clena 

to do this process we need eda (explaratory data analysis )

EDA --> 
-----
1- variable identification 
2- univariate anlaysis
3- bivariate analysis ( corelation)
4- outlier treatment 
5- missing value treatment 
6- variabel transformation 
7- variable creation 

those above 6 technique we calld as feature enginnering 

1- variable identificaiton 

(family -->1)
---------
1- father -- dependent (y)
2- mother -- independ (x)

math --> (y = x )  | 1 d.v variable & 1 i.v 

simple linear regression algorithm 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
family -->2
4 member ( 4 attributes) (4 column name ) (4 features)
-----------
1- father - dependent variable  -- y 
2- mother - independent variable  --- x1 
3- son (5th grade) - independent variale  --- x2
4- daughter (3 rd grade)  - independent variable  --- x3

math -->  y = x1 + x2 + x3  
multiple linear regression algorithm 
-----
depdendent variable = target variable = predictive variable = y
independent variable = non target variabel == non predictive variable  = x
=====
variabel identification divide into 2 part -->

- independent variable == non targert -- non predicted varaibe == x
- dependent variable == target -- predicted == y

Regression -->
if d.v is continuous then this concept is called regression

when we lot of numerical values are missing ?? how do youfill it
using python code (.fillna) | pyuthon
- from sklear.imputer import simpleimputer (ml code packages) 


fill the missing numerical attribute -- 
mean strategy | median strategy | mode strategy
122 column | 2cr row

mean,median & mode (if numerical values are missing)
if categorical data missing ( model strategy or knn strategy)

k-nearest neighbour  

5- MISSING VALUE TREATMENT
numerical values -- mean| median|mode
categorica -- mode | knn 

6- variable creation (IMPUTATION TECHNIQUE)
convert categorical data to numerical data -- dummy variable || one hot encoder
convert the categorical value to numerical in form of binary -- label encoder 

7- variable tranformation ( categorical we removed then transfered to numerical value)

missing value treatment - mean, mode, middian
imputation technique -- dummy variable | one hot encoder | label encoder

- population - sample == sampling technique
- population formula 
- key characterstic of population is --- PARMETER
---
sample - population == infernence technqiue 
- sample formula 
- - key characterstic of population is ---- STATISTIC 
-- 
in datasceince whatever dataset we are going to build the model that dataset is going to sample 
99% we are using sample formula 
-- 2. TYPE OF DATA --
- CATEGORICAL --  text, audi, bmw , etc

Numerica -->
discreate -- sat score 100%
continuous -- gold rpice,stock market and everything

Qulitative 
Nominal -- is not an ordered format ( four season)
Ordinal -- orderd format rate of the meal ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Quantitative data -->
interval -- 50-200 -- we dont get any zero values hear
ratio -- > ratio we will get zero values 

-how to visualize categorical data & numerical data 
-car sold - freququency in statistic 
many data anlaysis job, manger, mostly looking for distribution table 

how to frequecy distribution table -->
- dataset 1atrribute is given & 5 interval is given
- then we are using formulat to computer frequency distribution table

either you cat or numer -- the best way to visualize the data is graph, matplotlib, seaborn

linear corelation 

from today onwards i want to create formula sheet till day end 
math formula,

measur of assymetry -->
+Ve skew --  mean > median  & mode === (data stays at left & outlier is at right )
0 skew -- mean = median = mode ( data stays at cent & we dont have any outlier) 
			normal distribution = bell curve = gausian distribution = binomial distributeion 
-ve skew -- mode > mean & median == data stays at right & outlier is at left 

kurtois -->

skewness vs kurtois 

skewness is a measure of symmetry or asymmetry of data distribution,
kurtosis measures whether data is heavy-tailed or light-tailed in a distribution.

+ve skew = +ve kurotis = leptokurtic  == (>3)
-ve skew = -ve kurtoise = platykurtic  == 	(<3)
0 skew = normal distribution=  mesokurtic (=3)

Data can be positive-skewed (data-pushed towards the right side)  
negative-skewed (data-pushed towards the left side)
zero skews ( data stays at center)

measure of variablity -->
---
population mean - Meau 
sample mean - x bar

-- variance - spread of the data around the mean 
population variance  - sigma square 
sample variance - s square 
-- STANDARD DEVIATION

AGENDA FOR TODAY-->
--------
hypothesis testing 
type 1 error 
type 2 error
p-value 
central limit theorem
Advanced stats 


-- How stats would connect to machine learning regression (theory)
-- how stats would connect to ml classification (theory)

-- bng apple are expensive (hypothss)
-- 1apple cost is >200 (statment ) 

hypothesis testing 

where ever we have data - then can do hypothesis
where ever we dont have data - no  hypothesis

HT ->
- NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0)
- ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H1 or Ha)

if average ds salary = $113 |||| H0 == $ 113 (accept the null hypothesis)
if average ds salary !=  @113 || H1 !== $113(REJECT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS)

MOST OF STATICIAN alway want to reject the null hypotheis) 

-- ml -- supervised & unsupevsed

supervise -- regression & classification 

after we build regression model  

reinforcemt  -- generative ai |||open ai 

after we build regression model we need to test the model -- performance measures 
- what is performance measure in regression --- R2 & ADJUSTED R2 
- what is performance meauwse of classifcation -- confustion matrix ( type 1 & type 2 error )

type 1 error & type 2 error born from hypohthies testing 

-- hypothesis testing
-- null hypothes  & alternative hypotheis
-- when to accept the null hypohthies & when to reject the null hypothesis
-- what is model or logic 
-- performance measure of regression -- r2 & adjusted r2
-- performance measure in classifiction - confustion ( type 1 & type 2 error)

TYPE -1 Error -->
------
how these concept would help to classify in real time project ( happy or sad)
hot or cold 
up or donwn 

type-1 error ===> Reject the true null hypohthies == False +ve 
type-2 error ==> Accept false null hypotheisis == False -ve 

CONCEPT WE WILL DISCUSS ONCE AGIAN AT ML - CLASSIFICATION ( CONFUSION MATRIX)
confusion matrix -- TP | TN | FP | FN (4PART)

P-VALUE == 
95% -- 5% -- 5/100 == 0.05 

p-value is very important to eliminate irrelavatn attribute from the dataset 

dataset -- stats.api -- sl vlaue < 0.05 ==> reject the null hypohthies || remove the attribute from the dataset 

sl <0.05 -- we reject the null hypohthies
sl>0.01 -- we accept the null hypotheis

cental limit theorem -->clt
---------
sample should alway be greater then > no. of observation
